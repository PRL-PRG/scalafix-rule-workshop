# JSON Report and more

## Report Formatters

We have extended the tool to allow for different reports. For now, there are two reporters: `HumanReadableFormatter` (from yesterday) and `JSONFormatter`. Hopefully the output from the JSON formatter can be used to easily parse the report with any tool and it allows for easy analysis. The formatters take a hierarchy of `case class`es as input, so even if the reports were not useful, at least we have that tree structure to traverse.

An example output of the JSON formatter:

Source:

```scala
// aux/EmployeeDefinitions.scala
package aux

object EmployeeDefinitions {
  case class Employee(name: String)
  implicit val richard = Employee("Richard")
}

// ImplicitContext_Test.scala
package implicits

object ImplicitContext_Test {
    import aux.EmployeeDefinitions._
    case class Boss(name: String)

    // Define a single context
    implicit val barbara = Boss("Barbara")
    // Usage
    def getEmployee(id: Int)(implicit e: Employee, b: Boss) : String = {s"${id}: ${e.name}, ${b.name}"}

    getEmployee(12)
}
```

Report

      "location": {
        "line": 14,
        "col": 4,
        "sourceFile": "scala/implicits/ImplicitContext_Test.scala"
      }

      },

        "name": "_root_.aux.EmployeeDefinitions.richard.",
        "declaration": {
          "name": "richard",
          "location": {
            "line": 0,
            "col": 26,
            "sourceFile": "_Synthetic_"
          }
        }
      },
      { 
        "name": "_root_.implicits.ImplicitContext_Test.barbara.",
        "declaration": {
          "name": "barbara",
          "location": {
            "line": 0,
            "col": 61,
            "sourceFile": "_Synthetic_"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Case Class hierarchy

The class hierarchy used to represent the use of implicit parameters in function calls is the follwoing:

```scala
case class CallsWithImplicitsReport(items: List[CallWithImplicits])
case class CallWithImplicits(function: CalledFunction, declaration: Option[FunctionDeclaration], parameters: List[ImplicitParameter])
case class CalledFunction(name: String, location: Location)
case class FunctionDeclaration(name: String, location: Location)
case class ImplicitParameter(name: String, declaration: Option[ImplicitParameterDeclaration])
case class ImplicitParameterDeclaration(name: String, location: Location)
case class Location(line: Int, col: Int, sourceFile: String)
```

As a side note, working within a single file is starting to get annoying.

## Running it on a project

Running our rule on a real SBT project (gitbucket) was extremely easy, as it integrated well with sbt.

Examining the codebase took a minute (with the source previously compiled), and at first glance it seems that it did recognize some calls with implicit parameters in them. [Here is the report for one file](https://gist.github.com/blorente/291375ba2c41db3da38495bb1b6fdc7e). 

Now, there could be some issues with the formatting (leftover quotes in names, or whitespace), but those small problems are easy to fix and should be fixed ad-hoc.
