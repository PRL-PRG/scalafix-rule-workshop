# Gathering data, SQL still sucks

Today we worked in defining the database schema, creating the database and enabling us to push the results of the rule to the server. In short, we:

- Created the database and its tables
- Adjusted the rule to spit out the correct information to the database
- Created a simple Python script to take the CSV files outputted from the rule and upload them into the server
