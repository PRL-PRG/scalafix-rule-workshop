# Visualization and workflow pipeline

We started to establish how the information pipeline should go. We decided that it would be best to do as little processing in the rule as possible, and let it output the information to a convenient format. Filip did some experiments with visualization, and we settled in having the rule output CSV files, so that it can easily be stored in a database. 

Therefore, the general workflow would be to:

1- Run the rule on as many projects as possible, generating CSV output.
2- Gather that csv data and push it to a database
3- Use the database to 
    - Generate visualizations for the data
    - Match for selected patterns
    
One of the early visualizations of the data can be found in the slack channel
