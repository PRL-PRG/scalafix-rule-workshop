# Visualization, pipeline and engineering work

The last weeks have been focused in getting an easy way to extract information from the projects and have it ready in a format useful to us.

With Olaf's help, Filip has had his PR to `scalameta` accepted, and it will be available with the next release of scalameta (should come shortly). Olaf has also helped us in porting our scalafix rule to a custom analyzer, which is a plain scala project now, much more manageable, and with the possiblity of adding dependencies such as `scalatest`. In addition to that, the visualization is now hosted in a docker container inside the `star` server at CVUT, which is a great step towards a deliverable artifact and easy reproducibility.

Lastly, we have been creating a runner system to automate the use of all the little scripts we developed to handle the data. The driving thought behind it is that a user only should need that script to run the whole thing (it downloads dependencies), which would hopefully make it easy for reviewers, should we submit an artifact. Some sample executions of the tool, in the order we would execute them:

- Download dependencies:

- Analyze projects (pushing to db is turned off here, but it is configurable):

- Merge all the reports into big csv files (as an alternative to databases):
