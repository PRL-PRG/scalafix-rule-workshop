# Some bash scripts and bugs

## Bash scripts

There is a colletion of bash scripts to import sbt projects and run scalafix on them without much hassle. I have tried it with gitbucket and it works alright.

[Instructions and code here](https://github.com/blorente/scalafix-runner)

## Refining output

We have been working on refining the output of the rule. Not really much to report, they are mostly minor changes and small tweaks to what information is shown.

Among other problems:

- We have not been able to find a way to determine whether a synthetic parameter is from the same package as the call it was inserted in (other than looking at fully qualified names). However, this is not very useful for now, better focus on other things.

## Advances in the Futures bug

Filip has discovered the cause of the bug, and it doesn't seem easy to fix. However, we could make it work for this project with some hacks.
